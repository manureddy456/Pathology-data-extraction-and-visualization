Automated Pathology Report Text Extraction and Visualization
# Project Overview
This project aims to develop an automated model for extracting text from pathology reports and creating insightful visualizations to enhance healthcare outcomes.

# Objectives
Automate the extraction of text from pathology reports.
Structure the extracted data for analysis.
Generate informative visualizations to aid healthcare professionals.

# Methodology

# Text Extraction
Utilize pyPDF2image to convert PDF pathology reports to images.
Apply Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using pytesseract to extract text from images.

# Data Structuring
Use regular expressions (re) to structure the extracted text into data frames.
Clean and preprocess the extracted data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

# Data Visualization
Employ Seaborn and matplotlib to create informative visualizations.
Analyze and visualize data to derive meaningful insights for healthcare outcomes.

# Tools and Libraries
OCR Tools: pytesseract
PDF Processing: pyPDF2, Apache Tika, pyPDF2image
Text Processing: re (regular expressions)
Data Handling: pandas
Data Visualization: Seaborn, matplotlib
